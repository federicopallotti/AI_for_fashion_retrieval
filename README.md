# AI_for_fashion_retrieval
Course project for Computer Vision &amp; Cognitive Systems @Unimore

The pipeline is developed as follows:

1) Module 1 : Blur Detection and Discard

2) Module 2 : Segmentation by Self-Correction for Human Parsing

3) Module 3 : Retrieval on YooX Dataset

4) Module 4 : Virtual Try-on using a Geometrical Transformation Algorithm.

The trained weights are in "Module 3 Retrieval/YooxQuery/data".

Update of 11/09: Added the code for modifying the originan dataset (in "Module 3 Retrieval/ExtractDatasetParsed") replacing the full body images with the parsed relative item.
This step is required for running a new test or train.

The dataset is not provided.
